By the end of this task you will know how to create hosts, switches, and links with different link layer characteristics (e.g., transmission rates, propagation delays, queue sizes, etc.). Knowing how to do these things will help you if you ever need to design a new network and test bottlenecks before you invest in actual hardware.

Networks are expensive to experiment on and tools like Mininet and Scapy allow you to run really complex experiments on emulated networks for free (and on your laptop)!\n",

By the end of this task, you know how to run entire programs (including code that you write yourself) inside hosts, switches, and any other node in an emulated network! This means you can test the impact of network settings on a webserver or appserver that you might run someday, craft and send packets to see how routers might react to them inside the emulated network (this process is used to find bugs and security vulnerabilities in network hardware without impacting real infrastructure), etc.\n",
