    "We're now able to run basic performance measurement experiments on emulated networks with Mininet. In this next task, we'll learn how to modify link layer characteristics and see how this impacts throughput. \n",
    "\n",
    "**[5 points] Step 1:** Modifying link layer network characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we'll need to do is learn how to change the link layer characteristics programatically. You will now write a function that is similar to the `create_new_topology` method from earlier, except it will now take link parameters as input and create a network topology which replicates those parameters. The specification is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Name*: `create_topology_with_properties`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Input parameters*: - a topology vector: `topology_vector`, a dictionary of link properties: `link_properties`. \n",
    "`link_properties` should have one key for each link in the network. The key should have the two end points of the link they represent and the link option dictionary as its value. For example: `link_properties = {'h00-s0': {'bw': 5, 'loss': 1, 'delay': '5ms', 'max_queue_size': 100}, 'h10-s1': ...}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Returns*: The `Topo` object satisfying the input topology and link properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Function logic*: The function should then create the topology while making sure that the link characteristics are defined for each of the created links. If no dictionary key exists for a supplied link property, then let the link be set with the following default value for that key. Defaults: `bw=10`, `delay='1ms'`, `loss=1`, `queue_size=10**5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** `topology.addLink( node1, node2, bw=10, max_queue_size=1000, loss=10, delay='5ms')` adds a bidirectional link with bandwidth, delay and loss characteristics, with a maximum queue size of 1000 packets and a packet loss emulator that drops roughly 10% of all packets. The parameter bw is expressed as a number in Mbit; loss is expressed as a percentage (between 0 and 100); and max_queue_size is expressed in packets. \n",
